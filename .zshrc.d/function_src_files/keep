# The "keeper" function suite originally appeared in several zsh-users
# posts in the fall of 2004.  It was published in summary form in the
# Shell Corner column on UnixReview.com in January 2005 at the URL

#
# The "keep" function accepts a set of file patterns as the positional
# parameters or a series of lines (expected to represent file names) on
# standard input.  It stores the expansion of those patterns, or the input
# lines, in the global variable $kept, and then displays the result
# formatted in columns, similar to an "ls" listing.  Its alias, also named
# "keep", prevents the file patterns from being expanded when the command
# line is executed; they're expanded in the assignment to $kept instead,
# so that the local settings of nonomatch etc. are applied.
